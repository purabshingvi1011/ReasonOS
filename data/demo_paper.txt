On Dataset Y, Model X achieved a 14.8 percent improvement in accuracy in the indoor setting.
This result was measured using the standard evaluation protocol with 1000 test samples.
The improvement was consistent across multiple runs with low variance.
No results are reported for the outdoor setting due to environmental constraints.
Additional experiments on Dataset Z showed similar trends under controlled conditions.
